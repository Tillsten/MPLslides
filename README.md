# MPLslides
by Till Stensitzki

##Introduction 

Very basic python presentation framework using only matplotlib.
This is mostly a prototype and if development will continue everything 
will probaly change. Can output to every matplotlib backend

## Example
See the `intro.pdf` for the pdf generated by example.py.

## Hello world
```python
from content import enumerated_text, add_image
from presentation import Presentation
from slides import TitleSlide, NormalSlide
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

pres = Presentation()
s = TitleSlide("Hello", "World")
pres.add_slide(s)

s = NormalSlide('Hello World!', 'Second Page')
txt = enumerated_text(['Foo', 'Bar', '123'], (0.1, 0.75))
img = add_image('mplslides.png', (0.05,0.05), zoom=0.5)
s.add_content([txt, img])
pres.add_slide(s)

plt.show()
```

## Content
In mplslides content is added to the slides in the form of functions.

When a slide is drawn, each content is called with the slide as the
argument. So the content function has access to the slide, including
the figure `slide.fig` and a default axis spanning the whole figure
`slide.def_ax`. The function is free to create new axes as needed from
the figure.

## Styling and Layout

Styling defaults and various layout dimensions are defined in styles.py.
